Unreal engine fish tank, to assist people who cant even take care of themselves


A digital fish tank can be an engaging and therapeutic tool for individuals who, for various reasons, cannot care for real pets. Using Unreal Engine provides the ability to create a hyper-realistic and interactive experience, which can be heightened with various sensors. Here's an expanded scope:

1. Objective
To create an interactive and realistic digital fish tank using Unreal Engine, AI, and sensors. This project aims to offer companionship and relaxation to individuals who might benefit from pet-like interaction without the responsibilities of real pet ownership.

2. Components
a. Hardware:
Four Displays: To create a 360-degree view of the digital fish tank.
Sensors:
Light Sensor: To mimic the surrounding environment’s lighting, adjusting the digital tank's lighting to match.
Accelerometer: To detect any movement or vibrations around the display setup. This can trigger fish reactions or water ripples.
Microphone: To detect sounds, allowing fish to react to voices or ambient noises.
Camera (optional): For motion tracking, so fish can "follow" viewers or react to their presence.
b. Software:
Unreal Engine:
AI Fish: Fish will have AI-driven behaviors. They will interact with each other, react to the environment, and engage with stimuli from sensors.
Fluid Simulation: To make the water in the tank look and behave realistically. This includes flow dynamics, light refraction, and interaction with fish movements.
Lighting: Dynamic lighting that changes based on the input from the light sensor.
3. Features
Interactivity: Users can tap or shake the display setup to see how the fish react.
Customization: Users can change the species of fish, background scenery, and other elements of the tank.
Ambient Mode: The tank can transition to different times of the day, weather effects, or even seasonal changes.
Therapeutic Mode: Slow and calming animations, muted lighting, and gentle fish movement to assist relaxation and meditation.
Learning Mode: The fish tank can provide information about different species, habitats, and more.
4. User Experience
The digital fish tank is designed to be intuitive. As users approach, the fish might come closer or scatter, depending on their programmed nature. When there’s a loud noise, the water can ripple, and fish can show signs of agitation. As the ambient light dims, the tank’s internal lighting can adapt, simulating a dusk or nighttime underwater environment.

5. Target Audience
This digital fish tank primarily targets:

Individuals in healthcare facilities, such as hospitals or nursing homes.
People with conditions that make pet ownership challenging.
Educational institutions for learning and relaxation.
Mental health facilities for therapeutic uses.
6. Future Expansions
Integration with Virtual Assistants: Allow voice commands to feed fish, change lighting, or get information.
Multi-Tank Ecosystems: Connect multiple tanks and have fish "travel" between them.
Augmented Reality: Use AR glasses or mobile devices to interact with fish in a more immersive manner.
7. Challenges and Considerations
Hardware Durability: Ensure that the displays and sensors are robust enough for frequent interactions.
Content Updates: Regularly updating fish AI, adding new species, or changing backgrounds to keep users engaged.
Privacy Concerns: If using cameras for motion tracking, ensuring that no personal data is stored or misused.
8. Implementation Timeline
Months 1-3: Hardware setup and initial software design.
Months 4-6: Development of fish AI, fluid simulations, and integration of sensors.
Months 7-9: Testing, bug fixing, and user trials.
Months 10-12: Final refinements and official launch.
By creating this digital fish tank, you're offering a blend of technology, art, and therapeutic value, contributing to the well-being of many individuals.
